# Mixtape
Mixtape is an Android library which greatly simplifies the task of displaying media to a user. The library provides high level caching mechanisms and is designed from the ground up to support asynchronous media loading. The interface driven design makes it easy to integrate the library into any existing app with any existing dataset.

Although all the components of the library are functional, the documentation still needs work and the automated tests need to be expanded. Once these tasks are complete, the library will be released to jCentre.
