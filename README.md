# Mixtape
Mixtape is an Android library which simplifies the task of displaying media to a user (e.g. books, movies, music etc.). The library provides high level caching mechanisms and is designed from the ground up to support asynchronous media loading. The interface driven design makes it easy to integrate the library into any existing app with any existing dataset.
